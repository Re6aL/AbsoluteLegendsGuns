<description>Abso-Lutely legendary pistols

v1.0.0.2 - fixes, sound upd, actual burst for fast pistol added
v1.0.0.1 - Gun Names changed based on user feedback

Introduces 6 RimWorld stylized Abso-Lutely must-have guns which are based on something you may know:

Desert Bird - long lost Desert Eagle which is only found in big-ass mods which overhaul the game too much (and I end up not using them).

FÃ¼hrers handgun - based on Luger 45 (for all your execution needs)

Python handgun (Fat Snake) - based on Colt Python with magnum bullets. Loud as F***

Fast pistol - based on Glock 17 (i dont like the VWE Quickdraw version because with CE it is too deadly) it is fast and light.

Makarov pistol - based on Makarov pistol. Small and light pistol from ussr

Golden Bird - well its just a gun made from Gold. its freakin awesome

Any suggestions are highly appreciated. Actually I am a graphic designer and not a coder. This is my first own mod, it couldnt be possible if i didnt look into others mods code, so basically all the weapon mods creators must get a shoutout here. Weapons code are heavilly inspired by Chicken Plucker, original Combat Extended mods creators. Thank you if you read this!

This mod was meant to be CE only but later i did split it into Vanilla version and CE Patch.
