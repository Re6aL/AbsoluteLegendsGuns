<description>Combat Extended patch now integrated. If youre using ModManager to make local copy - make sure CE packageid is CETeam.CombatExtended (delete "_copy") or patch wont work. I recommend using CE Github version - they update it daily.
As much as i tested everything works fine.

So... 6 RimWorld pistols, some are good use in early game, but GOLDEN PISTOL - is something you Absolutely want when you have nowhere to store all the gold in mid/late game.

Desert Bird pistol- Desert Eagle which is my all time favourite.
FÃ¼hrer's Luger - Luger 45 (for your psycho warden pawn).
Colt Python - Heavy and loud as F***
Fast Glock pistol - basically Glock ("VWE Quickdraw" is balance breaking IMHO, so i made my own version), still it's fast and shoots 3 burst shots.
Makarov pistol - most accessible, it cost less work and stuff.
Desert Bird's Gold - well its just a gun made out of Gold. its freakin AWESOME

I am a graphic designer and not a coder. This is my first own mod, it couldnt be possible if i didnt look into others mods code, so basically all the weapon mod creators must get a shoutout here. Modding is cool!
